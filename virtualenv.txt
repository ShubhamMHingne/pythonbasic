If you have multiple projects , if every project uses different dependencies for development you can isolate your every project from each other.

Installing virtualenv
>pip install virtualenv

Creating new virtual env
>virtualenv project1_env

Activating newly created virtualenv
>source project1_env/bin/activate

To verify which python type
>which python
>which pip

Also you can check the difference between multiple virtualenv by installing pip packages
>pip install numpy
>pip install putz
>pip list

Now exit your current environment by
>deactivate

list pip packages
>pip list

you will get the difference between packages.
